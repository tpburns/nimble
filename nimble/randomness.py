    Begin using a temporary new seed for randomness.

    Called to open a certain section of code that needs to a different

    reproducibility of later random calls outside of the section. This
    saves the state of the nimble internal random sources, and calls
    setRandomSeed using the given parameter. The saved state can then be
    restored with a call to endAlternateControl. Meant to be used in

    state of randomness in nimble.
