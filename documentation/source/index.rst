Nimble - python data science package
====================================

Nimble provides a unified framework for data science, data analysis, and machine
learning in Python that can be used as a more elegant alternative to the standard
stack (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn/sklearn, scipy etc.). Nimble can also be used
alongside these standard tools to make it faster and easier to make predictions and
manipulate, analyze, process and visualize data.

We believe the best way to learn about Nimble is to see it in action. So
we invite you to check out our :doc:`cheatsheet` and the examples below and
explore how Nimble makes data science easier.
