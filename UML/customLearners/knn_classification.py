"""
For a simple classifier you could implement a k-nearest neighbors
classifier. For any point you want to predict, just compute the
Euclidean distance of that point to every point in the training set.
Then sort this list. Take the k points that have the lowest distance,
and for your prediction use whichever label occurs most (among those k
training points with lowest distances to the point you are predicting).
If there is a tie, use k=1
